        text: `This short film is the middle part of the main character's story, which you are about to experience. 

He lost his home and loved ones as a child, and later his people were expelled from their native lands. Now our hero is forced to wander in search of a shelter. You don't know him, he's not from our planet - he's Yellow. Exhausted by kilometers, lost in space, he is approaching the main realization of his yellow life - his home has always been, is and will be inside him.

But here and there, suffering from constant chills and caustic memories, he will have to trust a stranger. And only after seeing stranger's inner tragedy, Yellow was able to temporarily forget about the nightmares inside himself.

Could you? Push aside fear and look into the uncomfortable soul of a person?`,
