He lost his home and loved ones as a child, and later his people were expelled from their native lands. Now the hero is forced to wander in search of the wind in search of shelter. You don't know him, he's not from this planet - he's Yellow. Exhausted by kilometers, lost in space, he is approaching the main realization of his yellow life - home has always been, is and will be inside him.

But here and now, suffering from constant chills and caustic memories, he will have to trust a frightening stranger. And only after seeing his inner tragedy, he was able to temporarily forget about the nightmares inside himself.

Could you? Push aside fear and look into the uncomfortable soul of a person?`
